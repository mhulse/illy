> A squircle is a mathematical shape with properties between those of a square and those of a circle. The word “squircle” is a portmanteau of the words “square” and “circle”. ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squircle))

> A squircle is a mathematical curve defined by the equation `x4+y4=r4`, while a rounded square is four 90° circular arcs of the same radius connected by tangent straight lines. In this construction, the two curves are arranged to coincide at angles which are multiples of 45° (i.e. 0°, 45°, 90°, 135° etc.).
