# Axonometric

> Axonometric projection is a type of parallel projection used for creating a pictorial drawing of an object, where the object is rotated along one or more of its axes relative to the plane of projection.

> The four types of axonometric projections are isometric projection, dimetric projection, trimetric projection, and oblique projection, depending on the exact angle at which the view deviates from the orthogonal.
